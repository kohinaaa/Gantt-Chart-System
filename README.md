# Gantt-Chart-System
Gantt Chart System is a desktop-based application developed in Python that visualizes project schedules through interactive Gantt charts. It uses Tkinter for the graphical interface and Matplotlib for chart generation, enabling users to manage tasks, plot timelines, and track project progress. This project demonstrates my skills in data visualization and GUI development using Python.
